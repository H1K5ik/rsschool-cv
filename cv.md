### About me
lthough I do not have any professional experience in frontend development, I have developed a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS during my academic career. I have completed multiple projects, including creating responsive web designs, building user interfaces, and implementing dynamic functionality using JavaScript. I am also familiar with popular frontend frameworks and libraries such as React.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a quick learner and passionate about frontend development. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in the industry. I am a strong team player and possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills, which have been demonstrated through my involvement in group projects during my academic career.
